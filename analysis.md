# Weather Station Data Analyzer - Analysis Document

## 1. Project Overview
**Project Name**: Weather Station Data Analyzer  
**Platform**: Java  
**Primary Purpose**: The application will process and analyze weather station data, such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure. It will generate reports based on this analysis.  

### Objectives:
- Process raw weather data (from files, e.g., CSV or JSON).
- Analyze the data for statistical information (e.g., average, max, min values).
- Generate detailed reports (e.g., text-based, CSV, or graphical).
   
### Constraints:
- No external APIs will be used (all data will be local).
- The data will be provided in files, such as CSV or JSON.
- No real-time data processing (this will be batch processing from historical data).

## 2. Project Scope

### In Scope:
- Reading and parsing weather data from files.
- Performing basic statistical analysis (e.g., calculating averages, max/min values, trends).
- Generating reports (text, CSV, or graphical).
- Handling different weather data fields (e.g., temperature, humidity, pressure).
   
### Out of Scope:
- Real-time data collection or live API integration.
- Graphical user interface (GUI) â€“ unless decided to add it later.
- Integration with external systems or databases.

## 3. Requirements

### Functional Requirements:
- **Data Input**: Ability to read weather data from CSV, JSON, or text files.
- **Data Processing**:
    - Analyze temperature, humidity, wind speed, and pressure.
    - Calculate average, maximum, minimum, and variance of each weather metric.
    - Detect trends or patterns in the data (e.g., increasing/decreasing temperatures over time).
- **Reporting**:
    - Generate a report summarizing the statistical analysis.
    - Reports could include text-based summaries or tabular data (CSV).
    - Optional: graphical representations of data (if extended later with libraries like JavaFX or JFreeChart).
- **Data Output**:
    - Reports saved in text or CSV format.
    - Option to display processed data on the console for review.
   
### Non-Functional Requirements:
- **Performance**: Efficient processing of large datasets.
- **Usability**: Command-line interface (CLI) for interaction, with clear output messages and error handling.
- **Scalability**: Ability to handle increasing amounts of data (e.g., more historical records).
- **Extensibility**: Future support for adding new types of weather metrics (e.g., air quality).

## 4. Data Analysis

### Data Sources:
- **CSV or JSON Files**: Data will be provided in CSV or JSON files containing historical weather data.
- **Data Format**: Each record will contain the following fields (for each timestamp):
    - **Timestamp** (Date and Time of the record)
    - **Temperature** (in Celsius or Fahrenheit)
    - **Humidity** (percentage)
    - **Pressure** (in hPa)
    - **Wind Speed** (in m/s)
- **Assumptions**: Data will be consistent (no missing values), and timestamps will be sorted chronologically.

#### Sample Data (CSV format):
Timestamp, Temperature, Humidity, Pressure, WindSpeed
2025-05-07T10:00, 22.5, 65, 1013, 5.4
2025-05-07T11:00, 23.0, 62, 1012, 5.1

## 5. Challenges and Risks

- **Data Quality**: The raw data may have missing values or be incorrectly formatted. A solution needs to be considered to handle these issues (e.g., filling missing data, removing faulty records).
- **Data Size**: Large datasets might affect the performance. The program should be designed to handle large input files efficiently.
- **Accuracy of Analysis**: The analysis methods (average, max/min, trends) must be clearly defined, and edge cases (e.g., data spikes, sudden drops) should be handled properly.
- **Reporting Flexibility**: The report generation should be adaptable, allowing easy future expansion if new types of analysis or data outputs are required.

## 6. Stakeholders and End Users

### Primary User:
- The user will be an individual or researcher who collects weather data and seeks to analyze it for trends, averages, and extreme conditions. The user will also require reports for presentation or documentation.
   
### Stakeholder Interests:
- **You (Developer)**: Interested in learning about data analysis and software development practices in Java.
- **Potential Users**: Users interested in analyzing weather trends or statistics without needing complex setups or real-time API integration.

---

## 7. System Design Considerations

### Modularity:
- Use clear separation of concerns (e.g., data parsing, data analysis, report generation).
- Use object-oriented design principles (classes for data, reader, analysis, and reports).

### Data Processing Strategy:
- Process the data in a batch mode. Start by reading the data, process it in memory, and generate the report at the end.

### Data Storage:
- The system will not use a database. All data will reside in local files, meaning that the program must handle loading, processing, and storing the reports.

## 8. Future Enhancements (Optional)

While this initial version will be focused on processing local data, there are several possible features to add later:
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: A GUI could be added using JavaFX or Swing to visualize data and reports in a more user-friendly manner.
- **Data Visualization**: Implement graphical reports such as line charts for temperature trends, bar charts for wind speed distributions, etc.
- **Real-Time Data**: While not currently in scope, a future version could incorporate real-time data collection from weather sensors or API integration if needed.

## 9. Timeline and Milestones

- **Week 1-2**: Data input and parsing (CSV, JSON).
- **Week 3-4**: Data analysis (average, max, min, trends).
- **Week 5-6**: Report generation (text/CSV).
- **Week 7**: Final testing and documentation.
- **Future**: Optional GUI and graphical enhancements.

## 10. Conclusion

The analysis phase provides a solid understanding of what the project will entail, including the requirements, challenges, and expected deliverables. The primary goal is to process weather data, analyze it, and generate reports. This clear understanding helps you move forward with the design stage in the SDLC.
