# weather-analyzer
Weather station data analyzer which will process and analyze weather data, creating a report based on the information.


points i do not need to forget before implementing this README file properly:
- when typying the file name there's no need for the user to type the extension (".csv"). As long as they type in the correct name of the file will be okay.
- make sure that each cell is filled with its correct data or with a "NA", "na", "-", " "
- reminder: this program only works with the headers: timestamp, temperature, humidity, windspeed and pressure.
- i recommend downloading the weather csv from https://www.visualcrossing.com/ since their headers are linked to the headers format i programmed, otherwise make sure that the csv in use have their headers mapped this way:
  datetime for the timestamp
  temp for the temperature
  humidity for humidity
  sealevelpressure for pressure
  windspeed for windspeed
